### Container Image Standards - App Container (appc)

The App Container (appc) specification was introduced in 2014 by CoreOS in collaboration with Google and RedHat. One of the container runtimes implementing the appc specification is rkt. The appc specification defines a container image format, how an application is packaged into a container image, a deployment mechanism and a runtime.

In addition to defining the Application Container Image (ACI) format for container images, the appc enables the user community to develop tools to build, validate, and convert container images to ACI image format, such as goaci, docker2aci, deb2aci, actool, acbuild, and oci2aci.

The appc specification intends to speed up the design and the deployment of a container while ensuring container image integrity through cryptographic signatures. Appc defines several independent, yet composable, aspects of the application container.

### Container Image Standards - Open Container Initiative (OCI)

The Open Container Initiative (OCI) was introduced in 2015 by Docker together with other leaders in the container industry. One of the container runtimes implementing the OCI specification is runC.

The OCI incorporates two specifications: the Runtime Specification (runtime-spec) and the Image Specification (image-spec).

The Runtime Specification defines how to run a "filesystem bundle" that is unpacked on disk. An OCI implementation would download and unpack an OCI image into an OCI Runtime filesystem bundle. Then, an OCI Runtime would run the OCI Runtime Bundle.

The Image Specification helps with the development of compatible tools to ensure consistent container image conversion into containers.

# Container Runtimes

<details>

https://github.com/opencontainers/runc

runc is a basic CLI tool that leverages the libcontainer runtime (initially developed by Docker, then later open sourced), together providing a low level container runtime focused primarily on container execution. runc implements the OCI specification, and it handles the creation and running of OCI containers.

Its simplicity, however, is not without shortcomings. runc does not expose an API and does not provide container image management capabilities. While it does not support image build operations, it does not provide image download or image integrity check capabilities either. That is, the creation of the container image components, such as the OCI bundle, is not part of runcâ€™s scope. runc may aid with the creation of the OCI spec, but the OCI bundle has to be created separately and made available to runc.

Although runc does not include a centralized daemon, it may be integrated with the Linux service manager - systemd.

Another simple container runtime is containerd, which adds robustness and portability by supporting several container operations, such as the storage and transfer of container images, executing containers, attaching storage and network to containers.

As an industry-standard container runtime, containerd was designed to run as an embedded daemon of a more robust container management system, and not to be used directly by everyday users. Among the adopters of the containerd daemon are the Docker engine, Kubernetes services of IBM (IKS) and Google Cloud (GKE), Cloud Foundry, and Kata Containers.

containerd supports the OCI container image specification and the OCI runtime specification by utilizing runc as its low level OCI runtime with the possibility to extend it with plugins to support the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI) as well. containerd adds implementation for some missing, yet desired, capabilities of runc, such as support for container image pull and push operations, and network interfaces and network namespaces management operations.

https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o

CRI-O is a minimal implementation of the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) to enable the usage of any Open Container Initiative (OCI) compatible runtime with Kubernetes, a popular container orchestrator. As a lightweight alternative to using Docker or rkt as the runtimes for Kubernetes, it supports both GPG signed and unsigned container images. CRI-O supports runc and Kata Containers as the container runtimes but any OCI-conformant runtime can be plugged in instead.

The CRI-O runtime has been optimized for Kubernetes, and it also implements the Container Network Interface (CNI) for networking and supports CNI plugins. Architecturally, CRI-O is packed with libraries that pull container images from registries and create container filesystems, a tool that prepares container configuration, then it invokes runc to start containers which end up being handled by conmon, a daemon that collects logs and monitors for hazards such as out of memory (OOM) conditions. CRI-O also supports container security that is provided by several core Linux features such as SELinux, capabilities or seccomp.

# Linux Kernel Network Namespaces

With network namespaces, you can have different and separate instances of network interfaces and routing tables that operate independent of each other. Kubernetes doeas create docker container with Network None, and then apply bridge(CNI) on that.
